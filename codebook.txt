1. Lexical decision task (lexdec)
These are the columns in the RAW lexical decision ("lexdec") data files in /nexp/data/. Note that columns 
are added to these data files in the R script "analysis" files in /nexp (see /nexp/README.txt), 
which are not explained here, but in comments in the script files.

<session>
NA

<list>
Experimental list

<group>
obsolete
(it stems from the older version with a different grouping of experiments)

<subject>
Subject ID.
Only use this column for Experiment 3.
Do not use this column for subjects of Experiment 1 and 2, and use 'subject_oexp'
for these participants instead.

<age>
age

<sex>
sex

<hand>
handedness

<assist>
assistant name

<trial>
number of trial

<file>
sound file name

<stimulus>
tansliteration of word presented in the trial; apostroph indicating absent schwa

<p_universal>
only existent in the raw data file of Experiment 3; "I" or "L", indicating whether 
the reduced version of a word results in an illegal or legal consonant onset cluster 
with respect to sonority sequencing principles.

<is_target>
"yes" or "no"; is the stimulus one of the 24 target words or not

<is_word>
"yes" or "no"; is the stimulus a word or nonword

<targettype>
"filler", "match", or "mismatch"
This column is obsolete
(it stems from the older version with a different grouping of experiments).

<red>
"r" or "u" or NA; reduction of the stimulus; NA for nonschwa words

<is_schwa>
"yes" or "no"; is the stimulus a schwa word/nonword

<duration>
duration of the stimulus in ms

<rt>
RT in ms measured from word onset

<rt_end>
RT in ms measured from word offset

<response>
"1" or "5"; 1 for left button response ('word' for left handed participants), 
5 for right button response ('word' for right handed participants)

<correctness>
"yes" or "no"; "yes" for correct response

<oexperiment>
obsolete; indicates the number of the original experiment in the old grouping of experiments

<spelling> 
"+spelling" group or "-spelling" group; only one value per participant (they either learnt 
with or without spelling)

<subject_oexp>
Subject ID for Experiment 1 and 2. Use this column for subjects of Experiment 1 and 2 instead of
the 'subject' column.
