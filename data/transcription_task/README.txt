1. Summary of Experiments

WARNING:
The grouping of participants into Experiments 1 and 2 (oexp1 and oexp2) in the transcription task
data does not correspond to the grouping used in the other tasks in /nexp/data  (i.e., lexical decision, 
vocabulary test, lextale task, questionnaire information; see /nexp/README.txt for details on those data). 
This is because we regrouped participants for our new analysis, and the transcription data still correspond 
to the old grouping. However, Experiment 3 is the same for all tasks.

OEXP1:

- All words were learnt WITHOUT spelling by ALL participants
- Group 1: exclusively learnt the full variants
- Group 2: exclusively learnt the reduced variants

OEXP2:

- All words were learnt WITH spelling by ALL participants
- Group 1: exclusively learnt the full variants
- Group 2: exclusively learnt the reduced variants

XP3:

Same grouping as for the other tasks (nxp3):

- All participants learnt both the reduced and the full variants for each words
- Group 1: without spelling
- Group 2: with spelling
